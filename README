VISUAL EXPLORATION OF NETWORK TRAFFIC (VENT)
README

=== COMPATIBILITY ===
Mac OS X v10.6.2
No other systems have been tested.

=== DEPENDENCIES ===
VENT depends on having Wireshark installed and in PATH. 

=== RUNNING THE PROGRAM ===
To start the program:
	python main.py
in the vent directory.

=== USING THE PROGRAM ===
1) If you try to break this program, you will succeed. Best to not try.
2) The only currently-supported PCAP file is hard-coded in. Attempting to load another may not work right now.
3) When you start the program, the layout will be virtually unusable. You will need to increase the size of the window, then resize the internal panes so everything is visible.
4) Add or remove search terms in the right pane. Click Search to create a new histogram showing your terms.
